We developed a Neovim plugin that integrates with Claude (Anthropic's AI) to provide:
- Conversation management within Neovim
- Code generation and extraction
- Buffer interaction commands
- Dynamic system prompt editing

Key Features:
- `:Claude` (`:Cl`) to send conversations
- `:WriteCode` (`:Wc`) to save code blocks
- `:BufferCode` (`:Bc`) to open code in new buffers
- `:CopyPrompt` (`:Cp`) and `:ReplacePrompt` (`:Rp`) for system prompt management
- Buffer referencing using `:b<number>` syntax
- Automatic filename generation
- Multi-model support

We refined the system prompt to emphasize code quality, readability, and language-specific best practices. We also discussed licensing, ultimately recommending the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3) as a copyleft license that ensures the project remains open source.

The plugin is written in Python, uses the Pynvim and Anthropic libraries, and provides a seamless AI-assisted coding workflow within Neovim.
